# 🔧 Zero to Hero: C# for Mechanics

## 🎯 Mission Statement
You've spent years diagnosing problems, using the right tool for the job, and understanding how systems work together. Programming is the same game with different tools. This course teaches you to think like a developer while respecting the systematic thinking you've already mastered.

## 🧰 The Mental Toolkit

### Core Principles (Your New Shop Rules)
1. **Read the Error Messages** - They're your diagnostic codes. Don't skip them.
2. **Start Simple, Build Up** - You wouldn't rebuild an engine before changing oil. Same here.
3. **Test Often** - Run your code like you'd test-fire an engine after each fix.
4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - If you're copying code, you need a method. Like using the right socket instead of forcing it with pliers.
5. **Break It to Learn** - You learned by taking engines apart. Same principle.

## 📚 Learning Modules

### 🟢 Phase 1: Foundation (The Basic Tools)

#### Module 01: Variables & Types
**Mechanic Analogy:** Variables are your storage bins - each holds a specific type of part
- **Concepts:** int, string, bool, double, var, const
- **Skills:** Declaration, initialization, type safety
- **Exercises:** 5 broken programs, 3 refactoring challenges
- **Time:** 2-3 hours

#### Module 02: Conditionals & Logic
**Mechanic Analogy:** If-else is your diagnostic flowchart - check condition, take action
- **Concepts:** if/else, boolean operators (&&, ||, !), comparison operators
- **Skills:** Decision trees, nested conditions, guard clauses
- **Exercises:** 6 debugging scenarios, 4 logic puzzles
- **Time:** 3-4 hours

#### Module 03: Loops & Iteration
**Mechanic Analogy:** Loops are your torque pattern - repeat the same action systematically
- **Concepts:** for, while, do-while, break, continue
- **Skills:** Counting, accumulation, searching, nested loops
- **Exercises:** 5 infinite loop fixes, 4 pattern generators
- **Time:** 3-4 hours

### 🟡 Phase 2: Organization (The Toolbox)

#### Module 04: Methods & Functions
**Mechanic Analogy:** Methods are specialized tools - each does one job well
- **Concepts:** Method declaration, parameters, return values, void
- **Skills:** Decomposition, reusability, method signatures
- **Exercises:** 8 "extract method" refactors, 3 method design challenges
- **Time:** 4-5 hours

#### Module 05: DRY & Refactoring
**Mechanic Analogy:** Like organizing your toolbox - eliminate duplicates, group related items
- **Concepts:** Code duplication, method extraction, single responsibility
- **Skills:** Identifying patterns, extracting common code
- **Exercises:** 6 "wet" code fixes, 2 large refactoring projects
- **Time:** 3-4 hours

### 🔵 Phase 3: Structure (The System)

#### Module 06: Classes & Objects
**Mechanic Analogy:** Classes are blueprints (like service manuals), objects are actual cars
- **Concepts:** Class definition, properties, methods, constructors, `this`
- **Skills:** Encapsulation, object creation, class design
- **Exercises:** 5 "build a class" challenges, 3 refactor-to-OOP exercises
- **Time:** 5-6 hours

#### Module 07: Collections & Lists
**Mechanic Analogy:** Collections are your parts inventory - organized, searchable, countable
- **Concepts:** List<T>, arrays, foreach, LINQ basics (Where, Select, First)
- **Skills:** Adding/removing items, searching, filtering, transforming
- **Exercises:** 4 inventory management scenarios, 3 data processing challenges
- **Time:** 4-5 hours

### 🟣 Phase 4: Advanced Tools (The Specialty Equipment)

#### Module 08: Enums & Switch
**Mechanic Analogy:** Enums are like standardized codes (OBD-II codes), switch is your diagnostic scanner
- **Concepts:** enum declaration, switch expressions, pattern matching
- **Skills:** State management, exhaustive handling
- **Exercises:** 3 state machine implementations, 2 menu systems
- **Time:** 3-4 hours

#### Module 09: Error Handling
**Mechanic Analogy:** Like safety protocols - check for problems before they cause damage
- **Concepts:** try/catch/finally, exceptions, null checking, defensive programming
- **Skills:** Graceful failure, validation, error recovery
- **Exercises:** 5 "make it bulletproof" challenges, 3 validation scenarios
- **Time:** 4-5 hours

## 🎓 Final Projects

### Project A: Auto Shop Management System
Build a console app that tracks:
- Customer vehicles (classes)
- Service history (collections)
- Part inventory (enums, lists)
- Billing calculator (methods)

### Project B: Diagnostic Code Reader
Create a tool that:
- Reads error codes (parsing)
- Looks up descriptions (dictionaries)
- Suggests fixes (conditionals)
- Logs history (file I/O)

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Each module includes:
- ✅ **Checkpoint Quiz** - Can you explain the concept to someone else?
- 🔧 **Hands-On Fix** - Debug the broken code
- 🏗️ **Build Challenge** - Create something from scratch
- 📝 **Reflection** - What clicked? What's still fuzzy?

## 💡 Remember

> "Every expert was once a beginner. The difference is they kept turning the wrench until it clicked."

You're not learning to code - you're adding programming to your existing problem-solving toolkit. The systematic thinking that makes you a good mechanic will make you a great developer.

**Estimated Total Time:** 35-45 hours
**Recommended Pace:** 1 module per week
**Practice Between Modules:** 2-3 hours minimum
